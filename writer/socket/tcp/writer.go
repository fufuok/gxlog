// Package tcp implements a tcp socket writer which implements the Writer.
//
// The tcp socket writer aims at log watching. For log transmission, use a syslog
// writer instead. With a tcp socket writer, you can use 'netcat' to receive and
// watch logs rather than the 'tail' which is inconvenient because a new log file
// will be created when a log file reaches its max size.
//
// For performance and security, use a unix writer instead as long as the system
// has support for unix domain socket. Otherwise, bind the address to localhost
// only.
